## 1. Abstract

In this project, an investigation is conducted into how the speed and storage costs of the FPHLM hurricane modeling project could be improved through the implementation of columnar data storage. Specifically, the performance of columnar storage is being evaluated through an empirical investigation. A comparison will be made between the performance of columnar storage and the current row-based storage system. Additionally, the performance of columnar storage with different compression algorithms will be investigated. Based on the results of this investigation, recommendations will be made for the FPHLM project.

## 2. Introduction

### a. Project Goals & Objectives

The aim of this project is to investigate the potential improvement in speed and reduction of storage costs for the FPHLM hurricane modeling project by implementing columnar data storage. The performance of columnar storage will be evaluated through an empirical investigation, with particular interest in its comparison to the current row-based storage system. Additionally, the performance of columnar storage with various compression algorithms will be studied. The findings of the investigation will be utilized to provide recommendations for the FPHLM project.

### b. Project Scope

The project scope is confined to the examination of the potential benefits of columnar data storage for the FPHLM hurricane modeling project. No other columnar storage systems or compression algorithms will be investigated, nor will other data storage systems be explored.

### c. Project Limitations & Constraints

This project's limitations and constraints include a focus solely on the FPHLM hurricane modeling project, with no consideration for other columnar storage systems or compression algorithms or other data storage systems.

### d. Feasibility Study

The project's feasibility is established by the availability of access to the FPHLM hurricane modeling project, which is essential for conducting the investigation. Additionally, the project's narrow focus enables the research to be executed within the available resources and time frame.

### e. Work Break Down Structure

The project will be broken down into the following tasks:

1. Investigate the FPHLM hurricane modeling project
2. Investigate columnar storage
3. Investigate compression algorithms
4. Design and implement a columnar storage system for the FPHLM hurricane modeling project
5. Evaluate the performance of the columnar storage system
6. Evaluate the performance of the columnar storage system with different compression algorithms
7. Make recommendations for the FPHLM hurricane modeling project

## 3. System Requirement Specifications (SRS)

### a. Be-spoke / MDRE

The SRS will be developed with consideration for the specific needs of the FPHLM hurricane modeling project. The development of a customized, be-spoke or MDRE solution will be considered if necessary to meet the project's requirements.

### b. Hardware Requirements

The FPHLM hurricane modeling project uses a bespoke data storage system. The data is stored in a row-based format (`.csv` files). The data is stored in a single file per year. The data is stored in a single directory.
