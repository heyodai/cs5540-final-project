## 1. Abstract

The objective of this research paper is to gain a better understanding of how to enhance the ingestion process of the data pipeline utilized by the Ozone Model. The present data pipeline for extracting and transforming the ozone layer data is already in place and operates by storing data in CSV format. Our approach will involve utilizing Spark with the Parquet file format to compare and measure against the existing configuration via test cases. Our hypothesis is that the implementation of Spark in conjunction with Parquet will surpass the performance of the existing configuration.

## 2. Introduction

### a. Project Goals & Objectives

The primary goal of this research paper is to optimize the data ingestion process for the Ozone Model. The data pipeline used for extracting and transforming the ozone layer data currently exists and operates by storing data in CSV format. Our aim is to utilize the file format Parquet with Spark to compare and measure against the existing configuration and to determine if the hypothesis that Spark with the use of Parquet outperforms the existing configuration is correct.

Through this project, we intend to identify the best data ingestion approach for the Ozone Model to optimize its performance. We will conduct a comparative analysis between the existing configuration and our proposed solution using test cases. Our research findings may enable us to recommend changes to the current pipeline and provide insights into better approaches for optimizing data ingestion in the Ozone Model.

### b. Project Scope

The scope of this research project encompasses the development and implementation of a data ingestion optimization solution for the Ozone Model. Our proposed solution involves utilizing the file format Parquet with Spark to extract and transform the ozone layer data, and our objective is to measure its performance against the current configuration that stores data in CSV format.

To achieve this objective, we will conduct test cases to compare the efficiency and performance of Spark with the use of Parquet against the existing configuration. We will measure and evaluate the execution time and resource utilization of both configurations to determine which approach is the most efficient and effective for the Ozone Model. Additionally, we will investigate the trade-offs between performance, storage space, and cost.

The project will also entail a thorough analysis of the existing data pipeline and the proposed solution. This includes examining the compatibility and integration of the proposed solution with the existing data pipeline, as well as any necessary modifications required to implement the solution.

The results of this research project will provide insights into the most effective data ingestion approach for the Ozone Model. The findings may help inform future improvements to the data pipeline to enhance the overall performance of the Ozone Model.

## 3. System Requirement Specifications (SRS)

### a. Be-spoke / MDRE

The system requirement specifications for this research project will be developed using a models-driven requirements engineering (MDRE) approach. This approach utilizes models to define the system requirements and allows for the automatic generation of system requirements from these models. The MDRE approach helps ensure that the system requirements are accurate, complete, and consistent.

The MDRE approach involves the development of multiple models, including a domain model, a goal model, a scenario model, and a use case model. These models will be used to define the system requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and assumptions. The MDRE models will be continually refined and updated throughout the research project as new information becomes available.

The MDRE approach will ensure that the system requirements are well-defined and aligned with the project goals and objectives. The models-driven requirements engineering approach will provide a clear and concise representation of the system requirements, which will aid in communication and collaboration between the research team and stakeholders. Additionally, the use of models will enable the automatic generation of system requirements, reducing the potential for errors and inconsistencies.
